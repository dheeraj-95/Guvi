window:
	- Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, also can be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window. 
	- The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.
	- All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
	- Global variables are properties of the window object.
	- Global functions are methods of the window object.
	- Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object:
		window.document.getElementById("header");
	  is the same as:
		document.getElementById("header");
	- Two properties can be used to determine the size of the browser window.
	Both properties return the sizes in pixels:
	   - window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)
	   - window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)
screen:
	- window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions. object contains information about the user's screen.
	- screen.width property returns the width of the visitor's screen in pixels.

document:
	- window.document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM. 
	- If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.
	- document.getElementById(id)			- Find an element by element id
	- document.getElementsByTagName(name)	- Find elements by tag name
	- document.getElementsByClassName(name)	- Find elements by class name
